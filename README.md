# Algorithms and Complexity
#### Instructor: R. I. Greenberg
Loyola University Chicago - Computer Science Department

## Required Text
Thomas H. Cormen. Charles E. Leiserson. Ronald L. Rivest. Clifford Stein. Introduction to Algorithms. Third Edition.

## Course Objectives 

This course will focus both on presenting general techniques for designing correct and
eÂ±cient algorithms, as well as on formal methods for proving the correctness and analyzing the complexity of
such algorithms. The course assumes some prior mathematical and algorithmic background and is intended to broaden and deepen that knowledge. Also included will be an introduction to the theory of NP-completeness, whereby certain computation problems can be classifed as being difficult in a formal sense.

### About the repo

The goal of this repo is to keep record of the this class and solutions to some of the exercises in the required book. You are welcome to add or suggest other solutions to questions in the book. This repo also contains scripts, homework solutions, Rmakrdown templates and resources part of the class.
